Our business generated a total sales revenue of 465.03K, showing a steady market presence.

When we dive into product categories, Clothing emerges as the top performer, contributing over 140K, followed by Furniture and Food, each contributing around 117K. Electronics, however, lags behind, signaling a potential area for improvement or targeted promotions.

Looking at how customers prefer to pay, we see that Credit Card transactions dominate (44.6%), followed by Cash (30.1%), and Bank Transfers (25.2%). This trend highlights the growing reliance on digital payment methods, especially credit cards, which drive nearly half of our sales.

From a customer perspective, more than half of the revenue (259.92K or 55.9%) comes from returning customers, while new customers contribute 205.11K (44.1%). This balance suggests that while we are successfully retaining loyal customers, there is also significant growth in attracting new buyers.

Regionally, sales are distributed across East, North, West, and South, with no single region overwhelmingly dominating. Each region contributes meaningfully, and across them, Clothing and Furniture consistently stand out as key revenue drivers.
